                <h2>ABOUT MARI GARS</h2>

                <p>The holiday of Mardi
                    Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are
                    concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash
                    Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major
                    parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and
                    most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final
                    week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including
                    parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).</p>
                <p>The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the
                    same parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick
                    Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several
                    modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe
                    of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their
                    parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as
                    well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float
                    riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of
                    colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
                    inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.</p>

                <p>   While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                    originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue
                    and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably
                    the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and
                    French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally
                    concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>
                <p> In countries such as the
                    United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is also known as Shrove Tuesday, which is derived from the word shrive,
                    meaning "to administer the sacrament of confession to; to absolve"</p>
                <p>Some think Mardi Gras may be linked with the ancient Roman pagan celebrations of spring and
                    fertility such as Saturnalia, which dates back to 133–31 BC. This celebration honored the god of
                    agriculture, Saturn. It was observed in mid-December, before the sowing of winter crops. It was a
                    week-long festival when work and business came to a halt. Schools and courts of law closed, and the
                    normal social patterns were suspended.</p>
                <p>On the Julian calendar, which the Romans used at the time, the winter solstice fell on December 25.
                    Hence, the celebration gradually became associated with Christmas.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p> The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the
                    mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish,
                    Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                    celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of
                    the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730
                    account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking
                    and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The
                    Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already
                    established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras
                    took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly
                    renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In
                    1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of
                    French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.

                    James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous
                    Pieces describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835:[2]

                    Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for
                    that is the day for fun, frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the
                    mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and
                    boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown,
                    exert themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic,
                    horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads
                    of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads; demi-beasts,
                    demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the
                    moon; mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on
                    foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches, cars, &c., in rich
                    confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing,
                    drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour broadcast as they wend
                    their reckless way.

                    In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to
                    organize a secret society to observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They
                    founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick Krewe of Comus.
                    According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its
                    celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a French festival.
                    It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead
                    in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To
                    a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To
                    a certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder
                    of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess helped them
                    construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in
                    organized Carnival passed from Creole to American just as political and
                    economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The
                    spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms
                    to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets, represents
                    the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely
                    American."[3]

                    In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday.[4] War,
                    economic, political, and weather conditions sometimes led to cancellation
                    of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War,
                    World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated
                    Carnival.[4]

                    In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official
                    parades were canceled or moved to surrounding communities, such as
                    Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came
                    to the city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with
                    National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen prevented crimes
                    against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating
                    morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French Quarter
                    bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.

                    In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required
                    social organizations, including Mardi Gras Krewes, to certify publicly
                    that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or
                    sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses.[5]
                    Shortly after the law was passed, the city demanded that these krewes
                    provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing
                    traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups.
                    In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to
                    demand otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus
                    and Momus stopped parading.[6] Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival
                    season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade
                    schedule in 2000.

                    Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law
                    as unconstitutional. Two federal courts later declared that the ordinance
                    was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free
                    association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups
                    subject to the ordinance.[7] The US Supreme Court refused to hear the
                    city's appeal from this decision.

                    Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership
                    is open to anyone who pays dues, and any member can have a place on a
                    parade float.</span></p>

                <p>In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our
                    current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and
                    paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on
                    wheels
                    by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming
                    Lenten
                    meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.

                    New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in
                    New
                    Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the
                    Marquis
                    de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi
                    Gras
                    balls of today.</p>

                <br>
                <p>The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                    governing body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of
                    hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.

                    By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback
                    riders to
                    celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members
                    and
                    lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed
                    the
                    Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus
                    brought
                    magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls.
                    Krewe
                    members remained anonymous.</p>

                <h2>Mardigras Traditions</h2>
                <p>Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big holiday in New
                    Orleans!

                    Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves
                    with long beads caught from the floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids
                    with their families are everywhere, and both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade goers
                    will sit on the ground, throw balls, play music, eat great food and watch the crowds walk by between
                    parades. On Mardi Gras day, the majority of non-essential businesses are shut down because of the
                    celebration.

                    Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away all the beads and
                    trinkets they will catch from the parades!

                    Every year, we get a lot of questions about how it all begin, and how the traditions have changed.

                    excitement of
                    Mardi Gras!</p>
                <p>The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also
                    called
                    Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big
                    event.
                </p>
                <p>Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private
                    Carnival clubs, called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade
                    goers. Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me something mister!"</p>
                <p>The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid
                    & Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes
                    add to the fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all ages.</p>
                <p>New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place to
                    be at any time of the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their
                    lifetime. Make your plans now to be a part of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say,
                    "Laissez les bon temps rouler!"</p>
                <p>sincerely,</p>

            <h2>ABOUT LaToya
                Cantrell</h2>

            <p>LaToya Cantrell (née
                Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
                Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office.
                Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from
                2012–2018</p>
            <p>Cantrell was born as
                LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier University
                of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive training
                program at the Harvard Kennedy School.</p>

            <p>  Cantrell returned to New
                Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she joined the board of
                the Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004.
                After the 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the
                Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and remained mostly deserted for months afterward.
                In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel convened by
                then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New
                Orleans neighborhoods to be converted into greenspace. In her role as president of the
                association, Cantrell worked with residents and local religious leaders to organize
                opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist returning Broadmoor
                residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.

                Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She
                and fellow residents formed the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and
                renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson school. She served as a founding board member of the
                Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community development corporation that provided case
                management and other social services for returning residents. She was involved with
                residents' efforts to reopen Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million
                grant from the Carnegie Endowment. She created a partnership between the Broadmoor
                Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which provided the neighborhood
                association with office space and hosted volunteer groups. She also formed a partnership
                between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic
                Church, to open the Broadmoor Art and Wellness Center.</p>
                <h1>Political career</h1>
            <p> In 2012, Cantrell
                declared her candidacy for
                the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when former District B representative Stacy Head
                won an election to an
                at-large position. After the November election, candidate Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced
                to a December
                runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote. Cantrell served out the balance
                of Head's term, and
                was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014.

                As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She
                introduced a bill
                banning smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of
                secondhand smoke on
                service industry workers. The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015.

                Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was
                objected to by
                residents because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans. Instead, the
                shelter was moved to the
                downtown site of the former VA Hospital. In 2017, Cantrell introduced legislation
                with at-large council
                member Jason Williams to register and inspect rental units in the city.

                As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to
                install crime cameras in
                her district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address
                understaffing at the
                New Orleans Police Department</p>
